<h1> Livestreamer GUI </h1>

An attempt at a GUI for the livestreamer application in order to provide several additional functionalities:

<ul>
  <li>The ability to retrieve streams by using the Twitch API.</li>
  <li>Allow the user to select a stream from the list of currently active streams.</li>
  <li>Pass the selected stream's URL to the livestreamer CLI tool to start the stream in the user's media player of choice.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Development </h2>

This tool is currently in development (only by me), so expect lots of hardcoded stuff and other things you should never do in a real product.
